***

DbUp Reboot is a fork of the [DbUp](https://github.com/DbUp/DbUp) project that focuses on modern technologies and development approaches.

This library supports netstandard2.0 and the following databases:
* Microsoft Sql Server
* Sqlite

The goal with this project is to focus only on the most popular databases and to keep the project up to date with the most recent libraries. 

I hope that community members can help out with answering questions in the forums. Pull requests are also encouraged and invited.
